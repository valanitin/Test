How to add keywords for creating internal links
======================

Several ways for adding cross linking keywords:
    
    1. A single simple keyword.
        It will add one keyword only. Example: keyword apple, the system will find 
        the word apple and replace it.

    2.  A single keyword with all its modifications.
	2.1. When adding a + at the end of a keyword/keyword phrase, e.g. iphone+, 
	    the system finds all variations that contain the keyword iphone at the
	    beginning and replaces it. Thus, the words iphone6, iphone5s will be replaced.
	2.2. When adding a + at the beginning of the keyword/keyword phrase,
	    e.g. +iphone,the system finds all variations that contain the word iphone
	    at the end and replaces it. Thus, the words appleiphone, bestiphone will 
	    be replaced. The words iphone6, iphone5s won’t be taken into account.
	2.3. When adding a + to at the beginning AND at the end of the keyword/keyword
	    phrase, e.g +iphone+, the system finds all variations with the word iphone
	    at any position within the phrase and replaces it. Thus, it will replace 
	    the words iphone, iphone6, appleiphone, appleiphone6.

	3. Multiple keywords with the same priority.

You can add multiple keywords with the same settings entering one keyword per line. 
The priority affects the order the system finds the keywords in and replaces them. 
E.g. if you have 10 keywords with the same priority, the system will use a random 
keyword and replace it first. If the maximal number of replacements per page is not exceeded, the other keyword will be taken. In order to prioritize the keywords, you should specify different priorities for them. The keyword with higher priority will be taken first.
	•	Multiple keywords with the reduced priority.
To add multiple keywords with the same settings but reduced priority at once, you can add one keyword per line. By default, it will add all entered keywords with the same settings and the reduced priority for each next keyword. E.g. if you enter 3 different keywords (one per each line), the first keyword will have the highest priority, the last keyword will have the lowest priority.
The priority affects the order the system finds the keywords and replaces them. The keyword with higher priority will be taken first.
